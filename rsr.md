## RNA Structure Ranking (RSR) 
  - **Impact:** Similar to proteins, RNA plays major functional roles (e.g., gene regulation) and can adopt well-defined 3D shapes. Yet the problem is data-poor, with only a few hundred known structures.
  - **Dataset description:** Candidate models generated by FARFAR2 (Watkins & Das, 2019) for the first 21 released RNA Puzzle challenges (Cruz et al., 2012), a blind structure prediction competition for RNA.
  - **Task:** We predict the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) from the ground truth structure.
  - **Splitting criteria:** We split structures temporally by competition year.
  - **Downloads:** The full dataset, split data, and split indices are available for download via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4961085) (doi:10.5281/zenodo.4961085)
