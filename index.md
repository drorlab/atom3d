## ATOM3D: Tasks on Molecules in Three Dimensions

ATOM3D is a unified collection of datasets concerning the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules, including proteins, small molecules, and nucleic acids. These datasets are specifically designed to provide a benchmark for machine learning methods which operate on 3D molecular structure, and represent a variety of important structural, functional, and engineering tasks. All datasets are provided in a standardized format along with a Python package containing processing code, utilities, models, and dataloaders for common machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch. ATOM3D is designed to be a living database, where datasets are updated and tasks are added as the field progresses.

- **Repository**: All dataset processing code and installation instructions can be found at [https://github.com/drorlab/atom3d](https://github.com/drorlab/atom3d)

- **Documentation**: Documentation for our Python package, including loading, creating, and interacting with ATOM3D datasets, is available at [atom3d.readthedocs.io](https://atom3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).

- **Paper**: Please see our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04035) for further details on the datasets and benchmarks.

### Datasets
  
ATOM3D currently contains eight datasets, which can be roughly grouped into four categories that represent a wide range of problems, spanning single molecular structures and interactions between biomolecules as well as molecular functional and design/engineering tasks.
