## Small Molecule Properties (SMP)
  - **Impact:** Predicting physico-chemical properties of small molecules is a common task in medicinal chemistry and materials design. Quantum chemical calculations can save expensive experiments but are themselves costly and cannot cover the huge chemical space spanned by candidate molecules. 
  - **Dataset description:** We use the QM9 dataset (Ruddigkeit et al., 2012; Ramakrishnan et al., 2014), which contains structures and energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134,000 stable small organic molecules, obtained from quantum-chemical calculations. 
  - **Task:** We predict all molecular properties from the ground-state structure.
  - **Splitting criteria:** We split molecules randomly.
  - **Downloads:** The full dataset, split data, and split indices are available for download via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4911142) (doi:10.5281/zenodo.4911142)
